Technical Breakdown:

The backend leverages Langchain, a framework facilitating file reading, prompt formatting, memory management, and chaining functionalities across services. Here's a detailed breakdown of each service:

1. Resume Enhancement:

User uploads their resume.
Langchain reads the uploaded file and passes its content to the AI model.
The AI model analyzes the resume content and generates a prompt focused on improvements.
Prompt engineering techniques refine the prompt for optimal results.
The AI model processes the prompt and generates an enhanced version of the resume with suggestions for improvement.
The enhanced resume and any text-based responses from the AI are presented to the user.
2. Interview Preparation:

User selects interview preparation and provides details about the desired job (job description, company).

Langchain manages the prompt creation process, considering the user-provided information and incorporating elements like:

Skills and experience from the user's profile (potentially retrieved from the uploaded resume)
Job description keywords and requirements
The prompt is sent to the Large Language Model (LLM).

The LLM generates interview questions tailored to the specific job description, skills, and experience mentioned in the prompt.

The LLM also generates potential answers to these questions, providing users with a starting point for practicing their responses.

Questions and answers are delivered to the user interface.

3. Mock Interviews:

User chooses mock interview and specifies the number of desired questions.

Langchain utilizes a loop to manage the question-answer cycle.

Within the loop:

The LLM generates interview questions based on the user's profile and job details.
The question is displayed on the user interface.
The user provides their answer through the chat UI.
The LLM validates the user's answer (potentially using pre-defined criteria or comparing it to sample answers).
The LLM provides feedback on the user's answer, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.
Once the loop completes (all questions answered), the LLM offers a comprehensive feedback report summarizing the user's overall performance.
